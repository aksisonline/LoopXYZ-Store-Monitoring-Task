## Suggestions

I think the uptime and downtime calculations could be offloaded to the SQL Server, cause I feel that would really reduce the load on the python script. This is just still a hypothesis but with good base for trail and error.

### Personal Note

I noticed on the Notion page that there’s a plagiarism check for code. As I mentioned in my cover message when applying, I primarily work as an AI-pair-programmer because I enjoy how tools like GitHub Copilot and Vercel’s v0 accelerate my ideas. My role involves troubleshooting and directing the AI to code the logic I envision, as I have a solid understanding of how code works. I’m proud to say that I didn’t start coding because of AI but due to my genuine passion for computers since my kindergarden, while I got introduced to coding in 2nd grade.
